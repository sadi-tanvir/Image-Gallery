# Image Gallery App

Throughout the development of this project, I intentionally chose to implement all the functionality using raw JavaScript. While I could have leveraged external libraries like 'react-beautiful-dnd' for drag-and-drop functionality, I opted to explore and implement the features using my own creative ideas. This decision allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and further hone my development skills.
